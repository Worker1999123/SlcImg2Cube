# SlcImg2Cube
This python based program developed by M5 Lab/SWC Lab demands to build 3d object from 2d images, gives serveral options for users to generate objects. It's so frustrated for the developer for keep occuring little bugs, so I decide to upload this public version.
## I/O
It reads .dcm/.png files. Note that the png files is processed or not, if not please use the "imgprcs" program.
For each input, the program outputs folder of slicing dcm files, a stl model, an off model, a xyz model and a data file.
